            <p>I have been married for 22 years and blessed to be the mother of two teenagers.  I have a Bachelors degree in Business from Miami University and have been certified in group fitness and certified through AAAI/ISMA as a personal trainer.  My fitness career began 20 years ago when I began taking fitness classes at a local gym.  I quickly realized that I loved fitness and needed to make it a daily routine in my life.  I became a certified group instructor through AFAA and focused on inspiring, challenging, and motivating others participating in my classes.  I then expanded my love for health and fitness to include personal training so that I could work closely with clients and customize their fitness programs to include specific goals that improve their overall fitness and health.</p>
            <p> My  desire when training a client or instructing a group class is to help every client have a fun, positive, and motivating experience.  I want to help them  gain confidence in what they are trying to accomplish no matter what that goal is.  Fitness is a lifestyle with no finish line, therefore we need to incorporate fitness into our daily lives in order to maintain better health, strength, balance and mental well being.  You are never too late to start a fitness regimen or commit yourself to leading a healthier lifestyle.  </p>
